## What is a VPS
VPS(Virtual Private Server) can be called as your own dedicated virtual machine in the cloud.

## Benefits of a VPS?
VPS tends to have higher bandwidth and better DNS resolution capabilities as compared to your local home system which uses ISPâ€™s DNS resolver which is slow.

A VPS helps while performing various bandwidth-intensive tasks such as DNS resolution & brute-forcing. Alongside when performing such tasks on a local system generally blows up your wifi making it unusable for other users connected on the same network.

**Also, you can perform tasks 24/7; 365 days in a VPS, unlike your local system.**
